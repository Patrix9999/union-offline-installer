# Introduction

This project is just **unoffical offline installer** for [Union](https://worldofplayers.ru/threads/40376/) created in [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download) and using [HashInfo NSIS Plugin](https://www.pawelporwisz.pl/nsis/plugins/HashInfo/HashInfo.php).  
It supports all game versions: 
- Gothic 1
- Gothic Sequel
- Gothic 2 Classic
- Gothic 2 Night of The Raven

The installer tries to pick one automatically based on game executable [md5 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5), if it fails for some reason, allows the user to manually pick the version.
